##Battleships Web

This project is from the week 3 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
This project introduces the web architecture to us for the first time, using a
simple battleships game with Sinatra. Through this, we learn about CRUD, HTML,
CSS, sessions and cookies for the first time. It is also an important lesson in
how to run local servers and how information is transmitted in the form of
params.

##Challenges

This weekly challenge was obviously very different to what we have done to date
and I found that it was a lot to take in in one go. I didn't feel very
comfortable about all of this until near the end of the week. Calling p on the
sessions and params certainly helped to understand what was actually going on.
The fact that I tried to implement three game modes using the same controllers
and views meant that the code ended up being quite spaghetti, which is
definitely something that I should learn not to do in the future. That is also
the reason that there are a few broken/ pending tests. I am not really going to
change the contents of the repo since I want it to leave it as the same state
that it was in when I called it at the end of the week for this challenge.
